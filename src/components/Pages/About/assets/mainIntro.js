      <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Hugo, a self-taught web developer, with a master in Sociology. I
        started to learn Programming with JavaScript, parallel to my job, about
        one and half year ago. It started as a curiosity but didn't take long to
        turn into a passion. Recently, I decided to quit my job to pursue this
        passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am eager to learn new skills and I am actively learning (studying
        Redux now) and enjoying it greatly. As my skills and confidence grow, so
        does my desire to work on and with a team, to work towards a common goal
        and achieve something that will impact positively peoples lives. Not
        only would it help in speeding my learning curve but it would also bring
        a sense of completion to this learning process.
