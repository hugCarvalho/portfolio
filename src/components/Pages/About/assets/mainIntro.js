      <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Hugo, a self-taught Portuguese guy, with a master in Sociology.
        I started to learn Programming with JavaScript, parallel to my work,
        about one and half year ago. It started as a curiosity but didn't take
        long to turn into a passion. Recently, I decided to quit my job to
        pursue this passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am actively learning and enjoying it very much, but I would also very
        much like to work on and with a team, to work towards a common goal and
        achieve (something). Not only would it help to speed my learning curve
        but it would also bring a sense of completion to this whole process.
      </p>

        If you'd like to know more about me, just keep reading (after you press
        the button to make sure you are not a robot...)
